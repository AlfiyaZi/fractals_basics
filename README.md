# Fractals basics

Some fractals in Python, no fancy coloring, no optimisations (multi-threading, etc.), just basic algorithms :

- Sierpinsky triangle

- Sierpinsky carpet

- Mandelbrot

- 


# Requirements

- Python 2.7 (I didn't try with an other version)

- PIL (used to draw fractals in PNG's files)
